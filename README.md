## Platformer-Project

*** Changelog ***
- Optimized code by drawing the background & environment whenever the player inputs a command, dies, or the room changes.
- Optimized code by slowing down the core processing loop with pygame.time.delay(), should lessen the amount of actions needed and also make the player's movements more precise.
- Found a bug where a shadow follows the player until the screen updates.

*** Requirements ***
This project need pygame to run.
