## Platformer-Project

*** Changelog ***
- Optimized code by drawing the background & environment whenever the player inputs a command, dies, or the room changes.
- Found a bug where a shadow follows the player until the screen updates. Might change later, too tired rn. 

*** Requirements ***
This project need pygame to run.
